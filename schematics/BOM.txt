----------                  ----                        ---------
 U1                         ATTINY85-20SUR              SOIC-8
 R1,R2,R3,R4                Resistor 22-47 ohms         0603
 R5                         Resistor 4.7-10 kohms       0603
 ISP                        2x3 pinheader (NP)          2.54mm pitch
 J2                         1x8 pinheader (NP)          2.54mm pitch


 NOTE:

 (NP) parts = Not Populated.

 ISP header is only used for programming (from the bottom side of the board!)
 and probably doesn't need to be populated, just press programming cable
 with header pin inserts into the connector holes and tilt a bit during
 ATTiny85 ISP programming.

 J2 is for keyboard connection but as probably this will sit inside the
 keyboard (or in the middle of cable inside stress relief box) you will
 most probably solder the keyboard wires directly to the header.
